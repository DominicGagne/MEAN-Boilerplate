You should try to remove JQuery from the application unless you absolutely need it and cannot find an AngularJS way to do it.
If you must use JQuery make sure to JQueryLite or Mobile I dont remember the name.

Also, why do you have BootstrapJS files if you are using Angular Material? It will cause errors with your Angular Material files.
Pick one or the other.

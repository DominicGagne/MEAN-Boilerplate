<!--Example template if you use the angular 2 compatible code. -->
<!--HomeCtrl becomes an object that has functions and attributes appended to it in the controller.
From here they can be referenced in the html by the defined object 'home'. Basically we say 'On this template call the homeCtrl home,
and then we can reference its attrs and funcs by home.attr and home.func -->
<!--This ends up making the code more clear and will allow for nested controllers if you need to.-->
<!--<div ng-controller="HomeCtrl as home">
